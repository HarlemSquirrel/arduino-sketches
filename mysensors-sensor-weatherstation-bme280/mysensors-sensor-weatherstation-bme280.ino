/**
 * The MySensors Arduino library handles the wireless radio link and protocol
 * between your home built sensors/actuators and HA controller of choice.
 * The sensors forms a self healing radio network with optional repeaters. Each
 * repeater and gateway builds a routing tables in EEPROM which keeps track of the
 * network topology allowing messages to be routed to nodes.

 * REVISION HISTORY
 * Version 1.0 - Henrik Ekblad
 * Version 1.1 - AnonymousZebra
 * 
 * DESCRIPTION
 * This is an example of using the Bosch BME280 module, which can measure temperature, humidity and airpressure, 
 * and do so really accurately, while using very little power. A 3.3v and a 5v version is available, make sure to check which one you have.
 * It communicates over the I2C protocol.
 * 
 * This script uses the BME280 library by Embedded Adventures. Download it, and place it in your Arduino library folder. 
 * https://github.com/embeddedadventures/BME280
 * 
 * Connect your sensor's powerlines, and connect your sensor to the SDA and SCL pins of your board. 
 * On Arduino Nano SDA is pin A4, and SCL is pin A5.
 * On the Ardunio Mega and Due the SDA in pin 20, and the SCL is pin 21.
 * On the Arduino Leonardo and Pro Micro 2 the SDA in pin 2, and the SCL is pin 3.
 * 
 * This script has been written in such a way that it can at the same time function as a repeater-node. 
 * It can also easily be used on battery power. Booth features can be turned on in the code below.
 *
 * Finally, you can decide if you want the forecast feature to be turned on. This is a cool feature, 
 * but there is a catch: it also means that you are locked into taking a measurement exactly once a 
 * minute, to build up prediction data for the algorithm.
 * 
 * The reason so many variables have BME280 at the beginning, is so that it is easier to combine multiple sensors on one Arduino.
 *
